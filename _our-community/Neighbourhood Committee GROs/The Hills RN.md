<p>Welcome to The Hills Residents' Network!</p>
<p>Rich in architectural and cultural heritage, the sister hills of Mount
Sophia and Mount Emily form our home where we live, dine, work, study,
play and make lasting connections together as a community.</p>
<p>The Residents' Network is here to promote neighborliness, harmony and
cohesiveness amongst the residents and establishments within the area bounded
by Orchard Road, Prinsep Street, Selegie Road, and Rochor Canal Road.</p>
