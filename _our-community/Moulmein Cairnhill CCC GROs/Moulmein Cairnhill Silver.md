while staying physically active, socially engaged, and mentally strong.</p>
<p>With the support of community partners, grassroots volunteers, and agencies,
MOCA Silver offers a wide variety of activities such as health talks, fitness
sessions, digital literacy workshops, heritage trails, intergenerational
bonding events, and more â€” all designed to enrich the lives of our seniors
and foster a spirit of inclusion.</p>
