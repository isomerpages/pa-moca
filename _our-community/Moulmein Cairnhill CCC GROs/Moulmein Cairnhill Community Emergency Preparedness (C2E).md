<p><strong>Moulmein-Cairnhill Community Emergency Preparedness (C2E)</strong> is
dedicated to bolstering community resilience by involving residents, grassroots
leaders, educational institutions, businesses, civic/religious/voluntary
welfare organizations, and other community partners in emergency preparedness
and civil emergency preparedness (EP/CEP) programs.</p>
<p>The C2E team develops and maintains grassroots EP plans, structures, and
systems during peacetime, and organizes exercises to ensure operational
readiness. They also conduct EP activities to help the community prepare
for emergencies. During times of emergency, the C2E coordinates community
resources and leads the grassroots emergency response efforts to assist
affected residents.</p>
