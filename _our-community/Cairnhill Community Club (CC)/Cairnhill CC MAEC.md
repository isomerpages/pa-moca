<p>The Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC) at Cairnhill Community Club
plays a pivotal role in preserving and promoting Malay culture and traditions.
MAEC organizes a variety of events such as traditional dance performances,
music sessions, and festive celebrations like Hari Raya Puasa. These activities
not only provide opportunities for the Malay community to connect and celebrate
their heritage but also invite the wider Cairnhill community to participate
and learn about Malay customs and traditions, fostering a sense of cultural
appreciation and harmony.</p>
