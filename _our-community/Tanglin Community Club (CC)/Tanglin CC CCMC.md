<p>Tanglin CCMC is made up of volunteers who work with PA staff to manage
and maintain Tanglin Community Club. &nbsp;The CCMC meets regularly to
plan and organise innovative programmes that help bring residents together
to interact and forge friendships. &nbsp;Various executive committees are
formed to help the CCMC focus on specific areas. &nbsp;These include Women's
Executive Committee (WEC), Senior Citizens' Executive Committee (SCEC)
and Indian Activity Executive Committee (IAEC). Through the various cultural,
educational, recreational, sporting, social and other community-based activities
, the CCMC aims to promote racial harmony and social cohesion amongst our
residents.</p>
