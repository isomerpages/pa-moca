<p><strong>Pek Kio CCMC (Community Club Management Committee)</strong> is
comprised of dedicated volunteers who collaborate with PA staff to manage
and maintain Pek Kio Community Club. The CCMC convenes regularly to plan
and organize innovative programs designed to bring residents together,
fostering interaction and building friendships. To focus on specific areas,
various executive committees are established, including the Women's Executive
Committee (WEC), Senior Citizens' Executive Committee (SCEC), Indian Activity
Executive Committee (IAEC) and Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC).
Through a range of cultural, educational, recreational, sporting, social,
and other community-based activities, the CCMC strives to promote racial
harmony and social cohesion among our residents.</p>
