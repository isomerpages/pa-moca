<p><strong>Tanglin Community Club Management Committee (CCMC) </strong>is
made up of volunteers who work with PA staff to manage and maintain Tanglin
Community Club. The CCMC meets regularly to plan and organise innovative
programmes that help bring residents together to interact and forge friendships.
Various executive committees are formed to help the CCMC focus on specific
areas. These include Women's Executive Committee (WEC), Senior Citizens'
Executive Committee (SCEC) and Indian Activity Executive Committee (IAEC).
Through the various cultural, educational, recreational, sporting, social
and other community-based activities , the CCMC aims to promote racial
harmony and social cohesion amongst our residents.</p>
