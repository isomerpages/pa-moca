<p>The Moulmein-Cairnhill Family Life Champions (FLCs) work towards building
strong families and nurture a strong Singapore core with many helping hands
through family-centric events and outreach programmes. Together with various
grassroots organisations, government agencies and community partners, the
FLCs build communities of support to co-create a society where marriage
and parenthood are achievable, enjoyable and celebrated.</p>
