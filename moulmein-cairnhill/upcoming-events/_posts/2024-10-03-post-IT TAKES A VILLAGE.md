<p>oin us on 26 Oct 2024, Saturday, 1.30pm at Tanglin Community Club as we
aim to amplifying understanding, foster open discussions about mental health
at our upcoming festival.
<br>
<br>Things to look forward to:
<br>- An array of mental health films
<br>- Panel discussions
<br>- Mental awareness roadshow booths
<br>- Intimate sharing in small groups
<br>
<br>This year, we are focusing more on support for parents and caregivers,
children and youths.
<br>
<br>Keen an eye on this space as we bring in more partners to shine a light
on the mental well-being space.
