<p>Imagine a dreaded scene of heavy thunderstorms, overflowing muddy water
all around you as high as your knees, stranded cars, submerged corridors
and waterlogged furniture in homes, and helpless people waiting for the
rain to stop.</p>

<p>The whole area – bound by Owen Road, Dorset Road and Norfolk Road - was
extremely flood prone from the 1950s to 1970s, inundating the area almost
every year between December and February.</p>

<p>1954 was a year of several serious floods. On 27 February, an estimated
76 mm of rain flood many areas such as Rochor Road, &nbsp;Thomson Road,
Balestier Road, Orchard Road and Farrer Park (Pek Kio Estate). Flood
waters, (0.6 – 1.2m deep) in some areas, affected hundreds of homes and
many more people.</p>

<p><strong>The Worst Flood History in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>Haji Misiri, a resident of Pek Kio, vividly remembers these floods, “Once,
in the 1970s, the flood came so quickly, we were not prepared for it. I
had to swim,because if I walked, I couldn’t see drains or holes in the
grounds.</p>

<p><strong>The Flood Gauge</strong>
</p>
<p>Located at the junction of Cambridge Road and Carlisle Road, this old
one-metre flood gauge serves as a reminder of the frequent floods that
occurred in this area, especially in the seventies. Such flood gauges were
installed at many low-lying areas in Singapore then, to record the depths
of the waters and the severity of the floods. Not many are left standing
today.</p>

on 2 September 2020, where he mentions the flood gauge that still stands
in Pek Kio as a poignant reminder of the past floods and the effects of
climate change. Alvin Tan is the Minister of State for Trade &amp; Industry
and Culture, Community &amp; Youth, Adviser to Tanjong Pagar GRC GROs (Moulmein-Cairnhill)</p>
