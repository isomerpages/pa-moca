<p>We have a new speed hump at Truro Rd!</p>
<p>This is the 3rd speed hump in our neighbourhood, following those we built
in Carlisle Rd and Cambridge Rd. We've implemented this slew of traffic
calming measures in the neighbourhood, including road narrowing and blindspot
mirrors.</p>
<p>This will make it safer for motorists making turns, and for our seniors
on their daily walks and your children as they play in the neighbourhood
with their friends and neighbours.</p>
