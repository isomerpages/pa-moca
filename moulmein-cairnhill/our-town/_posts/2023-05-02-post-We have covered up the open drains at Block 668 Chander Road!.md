<p>We have covered up the open drains at Block 668 Chander Road!</p>
<p>We received feedback from residents that the open drain could be a safety
concern for our seniors and young residents.I’ve asked our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hdb_sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">@hdb_sg</a> team
to review the situation and am thankful that they’ve agreed to cover all
the open drains in the estate.These are little improvements that we hope
will enhance accessibility and safety for our residents.</p>
