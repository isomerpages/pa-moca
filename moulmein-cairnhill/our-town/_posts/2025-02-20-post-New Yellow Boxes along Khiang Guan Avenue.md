<p>Dear MoCa Residents (Lincoln Suites &amp; Newton Suites) and United Square
Visitors!</p>
<p>We have painted two new yellow box junctions at Khiang Guan Avenue. These
yellows boxes aim to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow for vehicles
exiting onto Newton Road and facilitate smoother exits from Khiang Guan
Avenue.</p>
