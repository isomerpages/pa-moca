<p>We’re conducting Repairs and Redecoration works on Newton Food Centre
from 1 Nov 2022 - 31 Jan 2023. Which means it will close during this period.
&nbsp;Team NEA and MoCa have been consulting our hawker stall owners over
the past year to plan for this. Yesterday, we held a town hall with our
hawkers to provide updates and hear their feedback. We continue to take
on board their feedback. The hawkers are looking forward to a refreshed
Newton Food Centre as Singapore’s re-opening to global tourists gather
pace!</p>
