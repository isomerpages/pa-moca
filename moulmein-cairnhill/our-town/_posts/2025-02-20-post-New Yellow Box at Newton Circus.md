<p>Heads Up, Drivers! Changes at Newton Circus/Newton Road Junction</p>
<p>We are making it easier for vehicles exiting Newton Road to enter Newton
Circus!</p>
<p>We will add a new yellow box and lane markings this week. This will facilitate
smoother turns from Newton Rd into Newton Circus, reducing congestion.</p>
