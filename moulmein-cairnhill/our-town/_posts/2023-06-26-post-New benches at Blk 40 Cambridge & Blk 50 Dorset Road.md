<p>Dear Owen Residents' Committee and Farrer Park Residents' Committee residents,</p>
<p>Thanks to your suggestions, we’re happy to update that we’ve installed
2 new benches at Blk 40 Cambridge Road and Blk 50 Dorset Road, for you
to use while waiting for your vehicle pick ups!</p>
<p>Thanks to Our Tanjong Pagar People's Action Party Town Council for their
swift actions in making this happen!</p>
