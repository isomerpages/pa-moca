<p>Over the years, many residents have shared feedback on the need to <strong>widen and enhance safety along the walkway at Clemenceau Avenue North</strong>,
especially for the students who use it regularly. 🚶🏻‍♂️🚶‍♀️</p>
<p>We’re pleased to share that <strong>footpath-widening works are targeted to begin in the first half of 2026</strong>.
This upgrade will make the walkway safer and more comfortable for all pedestrians.</p>
<p>A big <strong>thank you to the Land Transport Authority (LTA)</strong> for
partnering with us to make our neighbourhood safer.</p>
