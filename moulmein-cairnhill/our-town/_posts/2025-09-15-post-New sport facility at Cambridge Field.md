<p>Work is underway for our brand new sport facility at Cambridge Field built
by our partners, Tanglin Rugby Club!</p>
<p>We are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building a new entrance to the facility along Norfolk Rd, complete with
a new service road and car park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laying foundations for the new pitch and training cages, and constructing
the clubhouse. This will be followed by major pitch works, including installation
of a new drainage system, netting, goalposts, and finally, laying of fresh
turf.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once complete, we will get to enjoy:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A brand new, high-quality sports pitch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A modern clubhouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New and improved training facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safer and more convenient access via a new entrance on Norfolk Road</p>
</li>
</ul>
