<p>Like many of our MoCa - Moulmein-Cairnhill residents, I walk to and from
Newton MRT Station to Balmoral Plaza and beyond, and I know how narrow
the footpath is, particularly near the Good Shepard’s Loft along Bukit
Timah Rd.</p>
<p>Therefore, I’m happy to report that our MoCa and Land Transport Authority
teams have worked hard to widen the footpath.</p>
<p>It can now comfortably fit 2 adults walking side by side!</p>
<p>Big thanks to LTA for working with me and my team to make this happen</p>
