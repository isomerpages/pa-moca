<p>The Town Council has received feedback from many residents regarding the
choked sewage issue. They have conducted checks and found out that the
sewer line has been damaged from the soil movement.</p>
<p>‍
<br>
<br>The Town Council will be repairing the damaged sewer line. Safety barricades
will be placed around the work area. In the meantime, please keep clear
from areas where works are being carried out.</p>
<p>‍
<br>
<br>While the sewage line is under repair, the Town Council will divert the
sewer to prevent the issue of choked sewage. During this period, there
may be some unpleasant smell and dirt generated, but every effort will
be made to keep these to a minimum</p>
