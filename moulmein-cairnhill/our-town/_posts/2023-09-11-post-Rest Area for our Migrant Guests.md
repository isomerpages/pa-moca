<p>Weâ€™ve opened our Multi-Purpose Hall at Blk 668 Chander Rd to Our Migrant
Guests every Sunday and on Public Holidays. This opens up a comfortable
space for our migrant guests to rest and enjoy their break from work. Some
of them have been resting in the void decks of our Klang Lane blocks. We
will encourage them to rest at the Blk 668 MPH instead. If you wish to
partner us to supply some mats, refreshments etc, please email us at
