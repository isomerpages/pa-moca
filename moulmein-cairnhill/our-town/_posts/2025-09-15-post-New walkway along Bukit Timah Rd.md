<p>Over the years, residents have requested to make our pathways along Bukit
Timah Rd safer.</p>
<p>We have been progressively doing so. We recently upgraded another section
of the footpath. It is wider and set further back from the road, thanks
to collaboration with a new development in the area.</p>
<p>As part of our new cycling path network, the remaining footpath along
Bukit Timah Road will feature:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Wider paths for pedestrians and cyclists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased distance from the road for enhanced safety</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These significant improvements are scheduled to begin progressively from
2026. Thanks to everyone involved in this</p>
