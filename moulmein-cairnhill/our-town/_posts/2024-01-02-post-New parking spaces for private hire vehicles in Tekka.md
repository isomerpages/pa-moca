<p>You can now alight or board your personal or PHV vehicles along Racecourse
Rd at Blk 661. We worked with Land Transport Authority to convert 3 of
the 7 taxi spots to 2 pick up / drop off spots for your <a href="http://convenience.You" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">convenience.You</a> donâ€™t
