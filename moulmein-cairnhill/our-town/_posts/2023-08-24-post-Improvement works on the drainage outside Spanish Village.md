<p>Residents living along Farrer Rd near Blk 5 and Farrer Rd MRT told me
that the path behind the bus stop outside Spanish Village gets wet and
slippery after heavy rain. After discussing with <strong>Land Transport Authority </strong>the
team acted swiftly to improve the drainage.</p>
<p>Thank you Team LTA for working with me and my <strong>MoCa - Moulmein-Cairnhill</strong> team
to get this done for our residents.</p>
