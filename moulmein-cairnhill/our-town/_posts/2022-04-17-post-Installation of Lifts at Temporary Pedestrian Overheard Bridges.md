<p>From Wednesday 20 April 2022, we will have lifts for the Pedestrian Overheard
Bridges (POB) linking Revenue House and Royal Square facilitating movement
around those construction sites.</p>
<p>This will make it easier for you to access the bridge and cross over that
busy street. This barrier free access will be especially helpful for seniors,
little children, folks with a pram or carrying heavy load, and those with
disabilities.Residents living at Gentle Dr, Chancery Lane and Jln Merlimau
can now look forward to a better experience getting to Royal Square and
to Novena MRT station for your daily commute.</p>
<p>Kudos Team Land Transport Authority for always thinking of our residents,
and for your hard work constructing the North South Corridor, which is
a futuristic project that will change the way we commute and live.</p>
