<p>DO NOT LITTER – CAMERAS IN OPERATION</p>
<p>NEA’s new litter cams are now operating 24/7 at Buffalo Road and 668 Chander
Road.</p>
<p>We continue to go hard against litterbugs to keep our Little India community
clean. Anyone caught littering on camera will be fined. There will be no
more warnings and second chances.</p>
<p>Under the Environmental Public Health Act:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First conviction – fine up to $2,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second conviction – fine up to $4,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequent convictions – fine up to $10,000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s all take responsibility and keep Little India clean, safe, and welcoming
for everyone!</p>
