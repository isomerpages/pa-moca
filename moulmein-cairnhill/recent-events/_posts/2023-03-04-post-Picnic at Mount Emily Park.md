<p>A cold day but warm hearts all around as we gathered today for a casual
picnic at Mount Emily Park. Honoured to have our Grassroots Adviser Alvin
Tan officially unveil the new fitness corner in the park, and to have our
little community representative say a thank you to the workers who made
it all happen.</p>
<p>Thank you to all who braved the rain to turn up on a Saturday afternoon
- it was wonderful to see familiar faces, greet old friends and to make
new ones!</p>
