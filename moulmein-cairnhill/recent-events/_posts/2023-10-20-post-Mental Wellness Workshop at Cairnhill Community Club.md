<p>In celebration of Mental Health Month, our MoCa - Moulmein-Cairnhill Moulmein
- Cairnhill Well Being Circle brought together our mental well-being organisations
to organize our Mental Wellness Workshop at Cairnhill Community Club.</p>
<p>Thank you Cairnhill Community Club, Balmoral NC and our partners for pulling
this together.</p>
<p>We learnt so much from one another. It's helpful to know that we're not
alone.</p>
<p>This is part of the important work of our Well-Being Circle to raise awareness
of and destigmatise mental wellbeing, provide safe spaces and platforms
for people to share their struggles, and share best practices to help one
another cope.</p>
<p>Special thanks to our dialogue panellists:</p>
<p>Ms Wendy Chua-Sullivan, Founder of Wand Inspiration</p>
<p>Dr Gillian Hendricks, Department of Emergency Medicine, KK Women's and
Children's Hospital</p>
<p>Ms Kathryn Wong, Professional lyricist, composer, and performing artiste</p>
<p>Mr Michael Cheng, Artistic Director, Tapestry Playback Theatre</p>
<p>Dr June Tang, Peer Support Manager, Caring for Life</p>
<p>Ms Cheryl Tan, Director of film, "Eggs"</p>
<p>And to Elias, whose sharing on his journey of fighting depression touched
so many. Thank you for reminding us to keep going, even when the going
gets tough.</p>

continued support:</p>
