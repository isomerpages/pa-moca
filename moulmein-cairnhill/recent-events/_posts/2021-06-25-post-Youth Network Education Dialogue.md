<p>“Learn to Learn” and “School is everywhere outside school!”</p>
<p>Those were some of the takeaways from the Education Dialogue that Education
Minister Chan Chun Sing and Grassroots Adviser Mr Alvin Tan hosted alongside
our Tanjong Pagar GRC Youth Network and Fahima Farha from Roses of Peace.</p>
<p>The panelist explored a range of topics which our youth were keen on,
including mental health, the jobs of the future, interview tips.</p>
