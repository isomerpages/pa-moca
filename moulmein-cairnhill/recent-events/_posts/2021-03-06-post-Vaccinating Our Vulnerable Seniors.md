<p>Our vaccination rates for our seniors are fairly good, but there’s room
for improvement, particularly those above 70 years old. One way to helpmake
it easier for them is for us to provide transport for those who need. Forseniors
who cannot go to the vaccination centres, we are making arrangementsfor
doctors to vaccinate them at their homes.</p>
<p>We’re aiming to get 2/3 of our population fully vaccinated by 9Aug. Please
help encourage your friends and family to vaccinate.</p>
