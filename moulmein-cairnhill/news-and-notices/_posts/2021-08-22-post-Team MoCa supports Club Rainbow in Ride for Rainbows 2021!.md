<p>Ride for Rainbows, organised by Club Rainbow to support children with
chronic illnesses and their families, will be held from 8 to 31 October
2021. In celebration of its tenth year of raising awareness and funds,
Ride for Rainbows empowers participating riders to “Ride your heart out”
by riding 1km for every heart earned or every $10 of donations raised.</p>
