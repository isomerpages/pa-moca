<p>Have any old shoes? Drop them off and weâ€™ll send them to our nonprofit
partner Soles4Souls, which will then process and sell them to non profit
partners in developing nations. The shoes are then sold to entrepreneurs,
helping them start small businesses to earn a sustainable income.
<br>
<br>Our Green MoCa and Tanjong Pagar Town Council are partnering Soles4Souls
on this initiative in support of our&nbsp;<a class="hashtag" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#SGGreenPlan</a>.&nbsp;
