<p>Phase 2 will commence and the operating hours will be adjusted as reflected.</p>
<p>Caltex have carefully assessed the situation and believe that the expansion
of operation hours will be well-managed and aligned with the parameters
outlined. LTA&nbsp;has also reviewed the situation.</p>
<p>LTA&nbsp;and Caltex will continue to closely monitor the situation during
Phase 2 and should there be any concerns or deviations from the expected
traffic patterns, they will take immediate action to address them</p>
