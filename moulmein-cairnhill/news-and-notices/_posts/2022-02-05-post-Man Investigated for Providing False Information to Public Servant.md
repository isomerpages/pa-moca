<p>A resident living in Blk 47 Owen Rd had claimed that he was attacked and
stabbed in his home by two unknown individuals and was robbed of $600 during
the assault. The resident subsequently made a police report on the incident.</p>
<p>The police investigated and found that the man had provided false information
to the police.</p>
