<p>We are happy to share that we will be opening another Pedestrian Overhead
Bridge (POB) across Thomson Road, linking Velocity with Goldhill Shopping
Centre, next week, on 17 Nov 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍
<br>
<br>This POB, together with the POB along Thomson Road that we opened in late
June 2021 (linking Royal Square with Revenue House), will provide better
sheltered connectivity.</p>
<p>‍
<br>
<br>By 1st Quarter 2022, we will fit both POBs with lifts to enhance accessibility
for the elderly, persons who are physically challenged and families with
babies on prams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍
<br>
<br>A big thank you to our LTA's North South Corridor Team for the hard work.</p>
