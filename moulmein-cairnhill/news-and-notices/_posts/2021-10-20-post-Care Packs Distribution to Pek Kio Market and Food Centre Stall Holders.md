<p>Adviser Mr Alvin Tan visited Pek Kio Market on 17 October 2021 to catch
up with our hawkers and residents. Care packs were distributed to them,
and our Adviser and GRLs shared our simplified 1-2-3 COVID health protocol.</p>
<p>Like many Singaporeans, some of our residents and hawkers have "met COVID-19"
and recovered from it. The good news is that we have gotten most of them
vaccinated, so when they meet COVID-19, they fight the virus with vaccine
protection, and then develop protection naturally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Tanjong Pagar Town Council has been diligently deep cleaning Pek Kio
market daily for the past week. We will continue to do so, as we live with
COVID-19. So come visit Pek Kio market (if you're vaccinated of course),
and support our hawkers!</p>
<p>Please get vaccinated and get your boosters!</p>
