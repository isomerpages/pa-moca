<p>The McDonald's Drive-Thru at Caltex Dunearn will begin operations on Saturday,
8 July 2023, at 2pm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve conducted town halls and surveys on this and continue to work closely
with our community partners, the Land Transport Authority (LTA), McDonald's
and Caltex to address your concerns. They have made adjustments that have
taken your feedback into consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance your safety and convenience and to ensure smooth traffic flow,
we’ve asked McDonald's and Caltex to implement phased opening timings.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback regarding the drive-thru or any traffic matters,
please email Caltex at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:starcard@chevron.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">starcard@chevron.com</a>&nbsp;or call
us at 6318 1000.</p>
