<p>The COVID-19 Multi-Ministry of Taskforce had to make a tough call, in
light of the fishery port cluster. From 22 Jul to 18 Aug, Singapore will
revert to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) which means, among other measures,
no dining in.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>This is another setback but the situation globally, and particularly in
our region, is dire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>The tightened measures will help buy us some time to vaccinate more of
our population. 50% of our eligible population are fully vaccinated, and
we are on track to have two-thirds fully vaccinated by National Day on
9 Aug.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>We remain, however, still concerned about the lower vaccination rates
of our seniors compared to other age groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>As of July-end, around 80% of residents in all age groups have been vaccinated
or have secured a booking, compared to 71% of seniors aged 70 and above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>So please encourage your friends, family and seniors to get vaccinated.</p>
