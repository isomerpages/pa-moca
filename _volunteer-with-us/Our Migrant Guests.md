<p>Welcome to "Our Migrant Guest" (OMG), a dedicated team committed to fostering
a welcoming and inclusive community for migrant workers within the Moulmein-Cairnhill
Constituency. Since our establishment in 2022, our team has been driven
by the recognition of the significant contributions made by migrant workers
and the desire to bridge the gap between them and local residents. Through
our various activities and initiatives, we strive to build a more inclusive
and cohesive community for all.</p>
<p>Join us in our mission to make a difference and celebrate the diverse
contributions of our migrant guests.</p>
