<p>Our Migrant Guests Taskforce was established with the primary objective
of honouring the hard works of our migrant friends who are the “hands that
build our community”. At the heart of the Our Migrant Guests Taskforce
is a commitment to creating a welcoming and supportive environment for
migrants who have chosen Moulmein-Cairnhill as their place for relaxation
and work. Our objective is not merely assistance but allowing our community
to welcome and honour our migrant friends. We invite the residents of Moulmein-Cairnhill
to join us in this transformative journey toward a more harmonious and
interconnected society. Your involvement can take many forms — from volunteering
your time and skills to participating in community events that celebrate
diversity. Together, we can create an environment where every resident,
regardless of background, feels a sense of belonging and actively contributes
to the rich tapestry of our community. Volunteer with Our Migrant Guests
and be the change you want to see.</p>
