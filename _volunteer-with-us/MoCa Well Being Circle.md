<p>The Moulmein-Cairnhill Well-Being Circle is dedicated to nurturing mental
wellness within our community through grassroots efforts. Our vibrant group
focuses on prioritizing well-being, fostering a supportive environment,
and encouraging open discussions about mental health. The Mental Health
Task Force offers a space for residents to connect, share experiences,
and combat stigma. Our community-driven initiatives, including workshops,
support groups, and awareness campaigns, are tailored to address local
needs.</p>
<p>Join us as a volunteer to help make a positive impact. Together, let's
build a brighter future for our neighborhood!</p>
