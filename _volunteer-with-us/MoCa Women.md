<p>MoCa Women, an initiative in Moulmein-Cairnhill launched in 2021, aims
to celebrate and support women in our community. This goes beyond commemorating
women on a single day or a particular time period. At MoCa Women, we ‘Inspire
to Aspire’. We look for everyday heroines to inspire women to aspire for
more and we champion key women’s issues in our community. We welcome women
and men alike who believe in equality and equity to join us! Volunteer
with MoCa Women and be the change you want to see.</p>
