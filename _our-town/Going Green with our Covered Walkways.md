<p>Have you noticed that the lights of some covered walkways in our neighbourhoods
have been switched off from 1am to 5am?</p>
<p>Don't worry, it's not a power trip! It's a new Land Transport Authority
â€“ We Keep Your World Moving initiative to conserve energy wherever possible.</p>
<p>LTA will be switching off selected stretches of covered walkways and bus
stops islandwide from 1am to 5am, when public transport has ceased operations
for the day. These locations are also where footfall is low.</p>
<p>Energy production has a carbon cost, so saving energy can be a great way
to help our environment. Every bit helps, and together, we can reduce our
carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Ping me or Our Green MoCa - Moulmein-Cairnhill if you have any suggestions
on what else we can do to help make our community more sustainable!</p>
