<p>It was a day of celebrations and friendships! We’ve work hard together
to refresh our beloved Tekka Centre.</p>
<p>Our Tekka Centre is special to so many of us. Decades of memories, a place
to gather, celebrate. The best place to get authentic local fare and a
warm family of our stallkeepers.</p>
<p>But we’re not quite done yet. We have a few surprises in store which we
will complete in a few months to add to Tekka Centre.</p>
