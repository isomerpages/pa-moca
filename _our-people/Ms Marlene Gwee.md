<p>The recipient of the PA OurCommUNITYSG prize is our very own Grassroots
Leader Ms Marlene Gwee!</p>
<p>She shared how her experiences as a child nurtured her passion to give
back to the community.</p>
<p>“When I was a child, there was a place at the void deck of the HDB block
near my place at St’s George Road. It was a place where I had built many
fun and warm relationships. As I got older, I learnt that this special
place was actually the Residents' Committee (RC) Centre.</p>
<p>I was born in a poor and broken family. As young as five years old, I
had to cook my own rice to go with soya sauce when my mom was at work and
mostly not home till 11pm. Every day after school, I would roam around
aimlessly to play. The RC Centre brought happiness to my life; it was where
I could draw, colour and sing. Through these activities, I also learnt
about perseverance and how to work harder for my goals.</p>
<p>Lantern-making was one of my favourite activities. I practised and practised,
and was extremely pleased when I came in 1st place during a lantern-making
competition. It was then when I owned my first ever Barbie doll which came
with a complete furniture set.</p>
<p>The RC Centre had given me many happy memories. I was able to learn from
adults who substituted the ones missing in my childhood. Now I volunteer
with Tanglin CC with the hopes to help families and children who are in
need of an individual they can trust in and approach for help.”</p>
