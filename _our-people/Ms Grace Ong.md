<p>Do you agree that education can contribute to breaking the cycle of poverty?</p>
<p>To Ms Ong, helping vulnerable families starts with empowering them with
knowledge and skills, especially educating children in these families,
with the aim of levelling the playing field for them. . "It all began with
one child. Before I knew it, we started a tuition programme that has been
running for six years for the children in the neighbourhood", shares Ms
Ong, Chairperson of Moulmein-Cairnhill Community Development &amp; Welfare
Committee and an active volunteer for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Ms Ong shares that although the programme requires a high level of commitment
from parents, children and volunteers, the cause is worthy. Since its inception,
she has witnessed many children who have progressed to higher education.
She also applauds the many volunteers who have supported this cause and
firmly believes that mentoring is a win-win journey, both the mentors and
mentees.</p>
<p>"While we only have 24 hours a day and spend most of these hours working,
I always find joy in volunteering. To me, itâ€™s an alternative form of stress
buster," says Ms Ong, who recalled a recent rough patch at work. She added
that volunteering has become a source of joy, especially when she witnessed
how their collective efforts became an assurance to families that they
are not left behind. Ms Ong adds, "While we are giving to the community,
the community is giving to us too because when we see our passion turns
into something good, our lives are more fulfilling too."</p>
