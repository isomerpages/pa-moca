<p>During our MoCa house visits, we had the opportunity to meet the Late
Dr. Tan Eng Liang, a resident of MoCa. Dr. Tan is a distinguished figure
in Singapore's sports history, the founding Chair of the Urban Redevelopment
Authority, an Olympian, a former Senior Minister of State, a Rhodes Scholar,
and a Member of Parliament. Despite his numerous achievements, Dr. Tan
remains humble and thoughtful.</p>
<p>We also had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Kathryn Tan, who, along with
Dr. Tan, shared valuable insights about their experience serving the nation
as a family.</p>
