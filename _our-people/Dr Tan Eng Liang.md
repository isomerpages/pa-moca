<p>Such an honour and inspiration to meet giants during our MoCa house visits.</p>
<p>Dr Tan Eng Liang is a giant of Singapore Sports, founding Chair of Urban
Redevelopment Authority, an Olympian, Senior Minister of State, Rhodes
Scholar and MP. Yet a humble and thoughtful senior. Thank you Dr Tan and
Mrs Kathryn Tan for taking time to speak with me, and sharing your experience
serving our nation as a family.</p>
