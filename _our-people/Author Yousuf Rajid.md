<p>Mr Yousuf Rajid is a humble, dedicated MoCa community leader. He is also
a talented artist, poet and national award winning author. But above all,
a devoted father and loving husband.</p>
<p>We launched three books he authored, and in character, he is giving the
proceeds from the sales to Its Raining Raincoats to support our migrant
worker community.</p>
<p>We cannot be more proud of him and our Pek Kio CC IAEC community.</p>
