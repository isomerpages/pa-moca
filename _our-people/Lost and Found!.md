<p>Lily, a white poodle was wandering around Tanglin CC when Neo, our colleague
found her, and pinged our &nbsp;volunteers to ask if anyone had lost a
dog.</p>
<p>Our Goldhill NC member Doreen responded and kindly volunteered to bring
Lily to the vet across our CC to help trace the owner via microchip.</p>
<p>But Lily was reunited with her mummy Sharon who lives just behind Tanglin
CC after she dropped by to ask if anyone had found a dog wandering around!</p>
<p>Thanks Neo and Doreen for your simple but heartwarming act of reuniting
Lily with Sharon!</p>
