<p>Meet Doreen, a dedicated member of the Goldhill Neighbourhood Committee
(NC), who recently went above and beyond to help a lost pet. When Lily,
a white poodle, was found wandering around Tanglin Community Club (CC),
Doreen quickly volunteered to take Lily to a nearby vet to scan for a microchip
and trace the owner.</p>
<p>Thanks to Doreen’s swift and compassionate actions, Lily was soon reunited
with her owner, Sharon, who lives just behind Tanglin CC and had come by
to inquire about her missing dog. Doreen's efforts were instrumental in
ensuring Lily's safe return, showcasing her commitment to the community’s
well-being.</p>
<p>Thanks Neo and Doreen for your simple but heartwarming act of reuniting
Lily with Sharon!</p>
