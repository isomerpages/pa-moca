<p>Remember the <a href="https://mothership.sg/2021/06/singapore-religious-respect/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Mothership.sg</u></a> article
about a Chinese woman paying respect to her Indian neighbour’s deity?</p>
<p>The corridor looked familiar so we took a second look and realised it
was in our MoCa community. The neighbours were the Krishnans and the Ngs,
who have lived beside one another for 37 years!</p>
<p>Mr Krishnan’s daughter shared the video because she wanted to show how
little acts of compassion continue to happen on a daily basis in our neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Our Adviser Mr Alvin Tan met up with the families to thank them for showing
and reminding us who we truly are as a people, and as a country.</p>
